Alternate power source, you can charge your project with a battery.
Today we will learn how to use a capacitor to store the energy from a solar cell, and power your light.


objectives: 
* use of a capacitor (don't get above the voltage level, will break like the led, but with more smoke)
* differences of a capacitor and a battery
* new frontier of capacitors as a battery (advantages and disadvantages)
